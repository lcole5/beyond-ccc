## What is this Project?

This project was originally created as an independant project by Lauryn Cole for ENG 470/570: Tech and Texts Capstone as taught by Dr. Mattie Burkert at the University of Oregon. Cole is and English major with Digital Humanities and Business Administration minors and works as a Social Media Content Creator for the English Department. "Beyond Captions, Collages, and Codes" was put together as a culmination of these interests and prompted by her participating in ENG 385: Graphic Narratives and Cultural Theory. After being introduced to the field of Comics and Cartoon studies and the rich body of work being constantly created by students at UO in the discipline, Cole thought that having a repisitory of this work would be beneficial not only to the English department and the Comics and Cartoon minor, but also exciting for students to have a spot to contribute and celebrate their work.

While working on this digital exhibit Cole worked closely with Dr. Burkert, UO librarians Franny Gaede and Kate Thornhill, and Mandy Gettler. Though this project was an experiment and a learning curve in the potential and limitations of creating a digital project and therefore has room to evolve, please enjoy looking at the student work currently hosted in the repisitory and make sure to check out the connected WordPress site that highlights the newest submitted comics!
